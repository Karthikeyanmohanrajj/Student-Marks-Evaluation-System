Student Marks Evaluation System â€“ Project Summary
Introduction
The Student Marks Evaluation System is a Java-based console application designed to assess student performance across multiple subjects. The program allows users to input marks for five subjects, calculates the total and average scores, determines pass/fail status, and assigns appropriate grades.

Objectives
To automate student performance evaluation.
To calculate total and average marks efficiently.
To determine pass/fail status for each subject.
To assign grades based on predefined score ranges.
Features
âœ… User Input for Marks â€“ Accepts marks for five subjects.
âœ… Pass/Fail Determination â€“ Identifies failed subjects (marks < 35).
âœ… Total & Average Calculation â€“ Computes total marks and average score.
âœ… Grading System â€“ Assigns grades (O, A, B, C, D, E, Fail) based on the average.
âœ… Console-Based Execution â€“ Lightweight and beginner-friendly implementation.

Technology Used
Programming Language: Java
Development Tools: Any Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code)
